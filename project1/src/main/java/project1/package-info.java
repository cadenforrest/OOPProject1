  * Add project description here
  This project was designed for our group members to implement various methods in order to complete the code skeleton. The goal of the program is to take in
  a dataset that contains three fields: a reviewer ID, a product ID, and the rating that the reviewer gave to the product. With this data, the methods we implemented 
  performed various calculations to return a few different key stats: the degree (number of times that an ID appeared within our dataset), reviewer average, and product 
  average that we then outputted.
